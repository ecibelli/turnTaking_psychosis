This project investigated whether turn-taking (the time from the end of one conversational partner's turn to the beginning of the other partner's turn) can be used as a reliable index of psychosis risk in adolescents as clinical high-risk for psychosis. The data set for this project comes from clinical interviews recorded with adolescents (12-24) who are experiencing prodromal symptoms of psychosis, and healthy age-matched controls. 

Background: In the psychosis literature, aberrant turn-taking behavior has been reported as being a hallmark of schizophrenia, related to positive symptoms and thought disorder. This has usually been assessed subjectively rather than quantitatively. Furthermore, there have been no studies on turn-taking behavior in young adults at risk for psychosis who have not yet converted/received a diagnosis. If there is a relationship between clinical risk and turn-taking in high-risk youth, it could suggest this speech feature as an early behavioral biomarker for psychosis risk.

About the code: Two analyses were conducted on our data set. One compares healthy controls to high-risk participants (groupAnalysis.R). The second restricts the analysis to the high-risk group, and evaluates whether symptom severity as measured by the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes (positive symptoms - e.g. hallucinations and thought disorder; negative symptoms - e.g. social withdrawal and anhedonia) co-varies with turn-taking behavior.

These analyses were reported in:
